Dynamic Tree-Widget for Plone
=============================

collective.dynatree provides the basic integration of the jQuery plugin
`jquery.dynatree.js <http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/index.html>`_ (at 
`google-code <http://code.google.com/p/dynatree/>`_).

Optional it also provides a full-featured Archetypes Widget with full 
ATVocabularyManager support, including hierachical VDEX-vocabularies.

Installation
============

Just depend in your buildout on the egg ``collective.dynatree``. ZCML is loaded 
automagically if z3c.autoinclude is available (default since Plone >=3.3).

Install it as an addon in Plone control-panel or portal_setup.

Usage
=====

--------------
Plain Dynatree
--------------

This package only provides and registers the javascript in the site. Addon 
developers can use it then in their own templates. Please refer to the 
`original documentation <http://wwwendt.de/tech/dynatree/doc/dynatree-doc.html>`_ 
for usage of ``jquery.dynatree.js``.  

-----------------
Archetypes Widget
-----------------

The widget is meant to be used on a ``StringField`` (single selection) or on a 
``LinesField`` (multi selection).

Example
-------
::

    StringField('single_leafs',
        required=0,
        vocabulary=NamedVocabulary('some_atvm_tree_vocabulary'),
        widget=DynatreeWidget(
            description="Select one option of tree. Only leafs allowed",
            leafsOnly=True,
            selectMode=1),
    ),
    LinesField('multiple_all',
        required=0,
        vocabulary=NamedVocabulary('another_atvm_tree_vocabulary'),
        widget=DynatreeWidget(
            description="""Select multiple options of the tree. All selectable.
                           Starts with 2 levels expanded.""",
            selectMode=3,
            minExpandLevel=2),
    ),
    
Widget Parameters 
-----------------
(additional to the usal suspects of TypesWidget)

selectMode
    1=single, 2=multiple
    
minExpandLevel
    Number of levels which are not allowed to collapse; default=0.

rootVisible
    Wether a root node should be showed or not; default=False.

autoCollapse
    Automatically collapse all siblings, when a node is expanded; 
    default=False.

leafsOnly
    Wether to select only leafs or allow also to select nodes with leafs; 
    default=False.             

showKey
   To show the terms key in front of the terms value set this to a format 
   string like ``"%s: %s"``; default=None. You can put HTML inside, ie. 
   ``<span class="dynatree-key">%s</span>&ndash;<span class="dynatree-value">%s<span>``.
   Thus you can apply custom formats.
              
-------------------
Example-ContentType
-------------------

An example ContentType is provided, but disabled by default. To enable it add
``collective.dynatree[example]`` to both, the eggs and zcml section in your 
buildout. Rerun buildout, restart Plone and install the 
``jquery.dynatree EXAMPLE Content Types`` as an add-on product.
